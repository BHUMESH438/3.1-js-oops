//class hide a lot of scene behind as the class are the layer of abstraction over the constructor function.So in es6 we inherit the property and methods fom parent by extend keyword
//extends--> key word links the prototype behind the secenes withoout having to think about that
//super--> is the constructor function of the parent class and it implements the constructor function of the parent class and we dont need to implement it manually like the parent.call(this,name,year)
//so without super we cant get the parent property and method because this acts like a new key word and along with the call fn it creates the empty obj and in that obj we pass the value by ref and that ref value is denoted by the "this" in the parent func.
class Student1 extends Personcl1s {

    //always need to happen first because this call to the super function is responsible for creating the "this" keyword in the sub class
